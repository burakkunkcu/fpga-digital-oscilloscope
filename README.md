# FPGA Digital Oscilloscope

This was my term project for the Digital Cirtuit Design course back in 2016. The design was implemented using VHDL and demonstrated on a Basys3 Xilinx Artix-7 demo board. It should be noted that this just an elementary design and there are several shortcomings.

I remember almost no details about my term project now, so I'm sharing the source files as is and I won't be able to give any support.
